    <article>
        <p>Hello, I am <strong>Carlos Eduardo Nieto Vesga</strong>, an international student from <em>Colombia</em>,<br>
         I am <em>25 years old</em>  and I arrived with my wife on August 17<sup>th</sup> to the city of Ottawa.<br>
          At <em>Colombia</em> I managed to finish a Bachelor degree as an <strong>Industrial Designer</strong>, <br>
          but my area of ​​emphasis is focused on digital design, such as 2D, 3D design and video editing.</p>

        <p>Moreover, I consider myself as an active person who likes to do outdoor activities such as running,
         playing soccer, cycling, among others. In my free time I like to watch Netflix series with my wife 
         and play online video games with my friends. One of the things I would like to do in Canada is get 
         to know new cultures and try the different types of food that can be found.</p>
